# Geometry Notes  
## Section 1-1: Points, Lines, and Planes  

### ğŸ“˜ Learning Goal  
I can name, draw, and label basic parts of geometry.

___

### ğŸŸ¢ Line  
A **straight path** that has **no thickness** and **never ends.**

- **Lower Case** and cursive: line $\mathcal{l}$.
- Two points with line on top: $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.

___
### ğŸŸ£ Plane  
A **flat surface** that has **no thickness** and **extends forever.**  
![[Plane Graph.png]] 
- Name **3** points that **aren't collinear**: $Plane$ $ABD$

---

### ğŸŸ¡ Collinear  
Points that lie on the same line.  

### ğŸŸ  Coplanar  
Points that lie on the same plane.
