# Geometry Notes  
## Section 1-1: Points, Lines, and Planes  

### 📘 Learning Goal  
I can name, draw, and label basic parts of geometry.  

---
### 🔵 Point  
Names a **location** and has **no size.**  

![[Point Graph.png]]  $Point$ $A$ or $A$.
___
### 🟢 Line  
A **straight path** that has **no thickness** and **never ends.**
![[Line Graph.png]]
- **Lower Case** and cursive: line $\mathcal{l}$.
- Two points with line on top: $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.

___
### 🟣 Plane  
A **flat surface** that has **no thickness** and **extends forever.**  
![[Plane Graph.png]] 
- Name ***3*** points that ***aren't collinear***: $Plane$ $ABD$
- *Capital cursive* letter in a corner: $Plane$ $\mathcal{R}$.

### 🟡 Collinear  
Points that lie on the same line.  

### 🟠 Coplanar  
Points that lie on the same plane.
