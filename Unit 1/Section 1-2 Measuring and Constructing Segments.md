## Section 1-2: Measuring and Constructing Segments

### 📘 Learning Goal

I can **define and construct the length and midpoint of segments.**

---

### 🔹 Congruent

- **Definition:** Same **shape** and same **size**.
### 🔹 Segment Congruence
[[Section 1-1 Points, Lines, and Planes#🔹 Segment]]

- **Definition:** If 2 segments have the **same length**, then they are **congruent**.
    
- **Notation:** $AB \cong CD$
    
- **Statement:** “Segment $AB$ is congruent to segment $CD$.”

### 📌 Segment Addition Postulate (SAP)

[[Section 1-1 Points, Lines, and Planes#📌 Postulate]]
- **Definition:** If point $R$ is between points $P$ and $Q$, then  
    $$\overline{PQ} = \overline{PR} + \overline{RQ}$$

---

### 🔹 Midpoint

- **Definition:** The **point** in the **middle** of a segment that divides it into two **congruent parts**.
### 🔹 Bisector

- **Definition:** A line, segment, or ray that **intersects a segment at its midpoint**, cutting it in half

---

### 📝 Example Problem

- Given $B$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AC}$. Find the length of $AC$:
    
$\overline{AB}=\overline{BC}$
$5x=3x+4$ 
$=2x=4$
$=x=2$

Then:  
$\overline{AC} = \overline{AB} + \overline{BC}$
	$= 5(2)+3(2)+4$
	$=20$

### ✅ Summary

- Two segments are **congruent** if they have the same measure.
    
- The **midpoint** of a segment divides it into two congruent parts.
